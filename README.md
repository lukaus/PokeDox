# PokeDox
A program to keep track of your Pokemon collection! Primarily to help me complete the national dex

By Luke Stanley

Version numbering is more of just milestones, can't even remember most of them, but here ya go:

VERSION 1.0 INCLUDES:

    -   Finished GUI
    -   Completed Pokemon list with dex numbers/types
    -   Filter for region, types and collection
    -   Search by Pokemon name function
    -   Saveable changes to data
    -   Fully implemented GUI
    -   Implement sorting/viewing by evolution family
    -   Make pokemon's icon appear in the proper panel when selected
    -   One pesky bug: Switching to evolution Family mode does not correctly change/display "Caught" status for that family. Feature disabled for now.
