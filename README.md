# PokeDox
A program to keep track of your Pokemon collection! Primarily to help me complete the national dex

By Luke Stanley

Version numbering is more of just milestones, can't even remember most of them, but here ya go:

VERSION 0.8 INCLUDES:

    -   Finished (visually) GUI
    -   Completed Pokemon list with dex numbers/types
    -   Filter for region, types and collection

'Blockers' for 0.9:

    -   Implement the rest of the GUI
    -   Implement persistence of data, either through serialization, or, more likely, writing and reading from pokemon.dat (eventually perhaps allow user-defined 'saves')


TODO for final version (0.9 - 1.0):

    -   Make pokemon's icon appear in the proper panel when selected
    -   Implement sorting/viewing by evolution family
